== Security

* There are no sandbox mechanisms in place yet (e.g. seccomp-bpf)

* TLS verification just checks the authenticity of the peer certificate chain against the provided *verifier* certificate. This assumes that the *verifier* certificate is a private authority. There is *no* checking of the subject name, host names, or addresses in the peer certificate (see Identity::tls_verify_callback in the source code).

* DTLS cookies are not supported.

== Miscellaneous

* There is currently no DNS support for host endpoints. All connections must use IP addresses.

* Prerequisite checking for Experimenter OXM's is not supported.
