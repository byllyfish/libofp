* 64-bit integers are sent 'as is' when using JSON. This assumes the JSON deocder supports 64-bit unsigned integers. There is no provision for encoding them in strings for compatibility with JavaScript, which does not support integers >= 2^53.

* There is currently no DNS support for host endpoints. All connections must use IP addresses.

* TLS verification just checks the authenticity of the peer certificate chain against the provided *verifier* certificate. This assumes that the *verifier* certificate is a private authority. There is *no* checking of the subject name, host names, or addresses in the peer certificate (see Identity::tls_verify_callback).

* DTLS cookies are not supported by BoringSSL.
